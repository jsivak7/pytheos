):
    """
    For running CHGNet relaxation at 0K for an inputted ASE Atoms object
    - NOTE that resulting energy includes the MP2020Compatibility corrections from Materials Project
        - (https://docs.materialsproject.org/methodology/materials-methodology/thermodynamic-stability/thermodynamic-stability/anion-and-gga-gga+u-mixing)

    Args:
        structure (Atoms): ASE Atoms object for structure.
        max_force (float, optional): Force convergence criteria for relaxation in eV/Angstrom.
            - Slightly lower than CHGNet default of 100 meV/Angstrom, good middle ground
        optimizer (string): ASE optimizer to use. Defaults to "FIRE"
            - Sometimes faster relaxation can be achieved with other optimizers like "BFGS" - do your own testing!

    Returns:
