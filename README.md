Python toolkit for high-entropy oxide simulations (pytheos) is an open-source package for studying chemically disordered crystalline materials with computational models.

Our interdisciplinary team focuses on high-entropy oxides specifically, as a part of the the NSF-funded [Penn State Materials Research Science and Engineering Center](https://www.mrsec.psu.edu/) (MRSEC).

Open-source packages such as [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen), [custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian), and [sumo](https://github.com/SMTG-Bham/sumo) as well as the [Materials Project database](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/) are heavily utilized to leverage existing computational machinery and data in studing these high-entropy materials.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/jsivak7/pytheos
cd pytheos 
```
2. Install the package.
- `-e` is for installing in editable mode (optional, but recommended).
```
pip install -e .
```
