Python toolkit for high-entropy oxides (pytheos) is an open-source package built for exploring chemically disordered crystalline materials with modern computational tools. 

Other open-source packages such as [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen), [custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian), and [sumo](https://github.com/SMTG-Bham/sumo) as well as the [Materials Project database](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/) are heavily utilized to leverage existing computational machinery and data bases.

**TODO** add in little DFT/MLIP blurb.

**TODO** add examples of successes here with descriptor definitions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jsivak7/pytheos
cd pytheos 
```
2. Install the package
- `-e` is for installing in editable mode (optional, but recommended).
```
pip install -e .
```

*Jupyter notebooks are (will be...) provided to demonstrate how to use the code in the `examples/` folder.*

**TODO** add `pytheos` architect info cause this is kinda cool.

## Development & Bugs
In case you run into any issues please contact me via email (jts6114@psu.edu) as this package is under active development. Thank you for any suggestions and contributions - I hope that this is useful to your work!
