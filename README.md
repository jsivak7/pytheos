# pytheos

Python tools for high-entropy oxides (pytheos) that I have developed over my PhD to assist in studying chemically disordered crystalline materials with computational methods.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/jsivak7/pytheos
cd pytheos 
```
2. Install the package.
- `-e` is for installing in editable mode (optional, but recommended).
```
pip install -e .
```
